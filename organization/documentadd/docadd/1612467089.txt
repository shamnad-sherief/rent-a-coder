The MSER algorithm has been used in text detection by Chen by combining MSER with Canny edges.
 Canny edges are used to help cope with the weakness of MSER to blur. 
MSER is first applied to the image in question to determine the character regions.
 To enhance the MSER regions any pixels outside the boundaries formed by Canny edges are removed. 
The separation of the later provided by the edges greatly increase the usability of MSER in the extraction of blurred text.
[8] An alternative use of MSER in text detection is the work by Shi using a graph model.
 This method again applies MSER to the image to generate preliminary regions. 
These are then used to construct a graph model based on the position distance and color distance between each MSER, which is treated as a node. 
Next the nodes are separated into foreground and background using cost functions. 
One cost function is to relate the distance from the node to the foreground and background. 
The other penalizes nodes for being significantly different from its neighbor. 
When these are minimized the graph is then cut to separate the text nodes from the non-text nodes.
[9] To enable text detection in a general scene, Neumann uses the MSER algorithm in a variety of projections.
 In addition to the greyscale intensity projection, he uses the red, blue, and green color channels to detect text regions that are color distinct but not necessarily distinct in greyscale intensity.
